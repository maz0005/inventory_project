This is a simple inventory application a seller can use to keep track of multiple miscellaneuos 
items such as clothing, furniture, electronics, books, and even items created by the user. Data is retreived from
the filel <inventory_data.txt>.

Requirements:
- "end_username_password is needed after username and password. If no username and password it should be the first line of the file
- "end_comany_name" is required after company name. Still needed even if there isn't a company name.
- "end_user_item is required after each item created by the user.
- "end_all_items" should be placed at the end of the file to tell the program there are not any more items.
